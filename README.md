CUmotive entails a small wearable mesh network which interfaces with a computer. The nodes of the mesh network gather data from accelerometers on the user's body and independently relay that information to the computer, which analyzes the data and translates it into commands for music, computing, or gaming.

This project contains AVR code for the microcontrollers running the nodes along with flext code for custom modules for Pure Data and Max/MSP.

This work was presented at the Eighth International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 08) in a paper entitled [Wearable Interfaces for Cyberphysical Musical Expression](http://www.nime.org/proceedings/2008/nime2008_237.pdf).
